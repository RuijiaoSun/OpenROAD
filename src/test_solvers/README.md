The "test_solvers" project aims to test the direct CUDA solver and the iterative
        CUSP solver on a 2 * 2 matrix before we apply them on OpenROAD project. 
        
The code uses the iterative CUSP solver by default.
For testing the direct CUDA solver, you will change it on Line 26 and 27 in the main() function.
